"A new platform is like a new musical instrument. You can transpose existing
music for it,  or write new music that exploits its unique expressive power.
The saxophone, for  example, solved two problems: it provided better
coupling and impedance between the  reed and the air mass; and the mechanics
offered better, faster fingering and a wider  range of notes. You could play
Bach fugues on a saxophone (rather nicely) or explore the  then-emerging
genre of jazz."

"The Internet itself was a community -- some even said a commune -- of
cheeky Unix users, if you'll pardon the pleonasm. They had the foresight to
divert (or pervert) defense funding into developing a unified set of
powerful protocols and wires interconnecting their computers. A simple Unix
